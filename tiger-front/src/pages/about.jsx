        <p className="text-xl text-justify">Founded in 1882, The Princeton Tiger is the nation’s third oldest college humor magazine, 133 years young (though we don’t look a day over 90). Tiger has housed many famous alumni, from F. Scott Fitzgerald to a former Editor-in-Chief of Maxim Magazine. Our March 30, 1893 issue contained the earliest print appearance of the delayed postfix Not!, and our November 1902 issued featured the first appearance of “There once was a man from Nantucket.” We’re funny, we’re marginally literate, and we’re free, distributed to every undergraduate room, common area, dining hall, eating club, and elite social circle in Princeton, even the equestrian team (when they get off their high horses).</p>
        <p className="text-xl text-justify italic text-gray-500">This organization is open to all Princeton University students interested in supporting our organization’s mission, regardless of identity, such as race, sex, ethnicity, national origin, or other protected characteristics.</p>
